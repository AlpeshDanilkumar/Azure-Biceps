# Azure-Biceps

Hey there! So, I've got this repo where I will be keeping all of my notes and Bicep code templates. Right now, I'm deep-diving into the world of Azure Cloud, and I'm going to be updating this repo regularly with my latest insights and findings. Stay tuned!

What is Bicep?
Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. In a Bicep file, you define the infrastructure you want to deploy to Azure, and then use that file throughout the development lifecycle to repeatedly deploy your infrastructure. Your resources are deployed in a consistent manner.You can use Bicep instead of JSON for developing your Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates).
